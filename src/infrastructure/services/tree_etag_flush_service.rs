/// Background drainer for `storage.tree_etag_dirty` — the asynchronous half
/// of the tree-ETag bump (see migration `20260627000000_async_tree_etag_queue`).
///
/// The statement triggers on `storage.files` / `storage.folders` only append
/// "bump request" lpaths to the queue, taking zero folder-row locks, so any
/// number of concurrent uploads never conflict with each other. This service
/// turns those requests into actual `tree_modified_at` updates: every
/// `interval_ms` it drains the queue and bumps the deduplicated ancestor
/// closure in ONE batched UPDATE with deterministic id-order locking.
///
/// Correctness invariants this relies on:
///   * The drain (DELETE) and the bump (UPDATE) are one statement — one
///     transaction. A crash mid-flush rolls both back and the queue rows
///     survive; the first flush after startup drains any leftovers, so no
///     bump is ever lost (a lost bump means sync clients never discover
///     the change).
///   * Queue rows are dual-keyed (`lpath` captured at mutation time,
///     `folder_id` re-resolved at flush time) and the target set is the
///     UNION of both — so neither a folder deleted/moved away (captured
///     lpath wins) nor a folder re-rooted by a move inside the flush
///     window (resolved lpath wins) can lose its pending bump.
///   * The bump is monotonic per folder:
///     `GREATEST(NOW(), tree_modified_at + interval '1 second')`. Folder
///     ETags have whole-second granularity (`{id}-{epoch_seconds}`, see
///     `Folder::compute_etag`); two flushes inside the same wall-clock
///     second must still produce two distinct ETags or a client polling
///     between them would permanently miss the second change.
///   * The flusher is the ONLY writer of `tree_modified_at`, runs as a
///     single instance, and locks victims in id order — so it cannot
///     deadlock against itself. It can still lose a race against a folder
///     move's descendant lpath cascade, which is why the statement runs
///     under [`retry_on_deadlock`]; a retried flush re-drains the intact
///     queue, invisible to users.
