//! This module re-exports domain errors for compatibility.

// Re-export domain errors for compatibility
pub use crate::domain::errors::{DomainError, ErrorKind, Result};

// Infrastructure error conversions have been moved to:
// crate::infrastructure::adapters::error_adapters
//
// To convert infrastructure errors to DomainError, use:
// - The IntoDomainError trait for explicit conversions with context
// - Or handle errors in infrastructure repositories/services
//   using map_err() with DomainError::internal_error() or similar methods
