//! Repository for [`Drive`] entities backed by `storage.drives`.
//!
//! Drives have no separate membership table — owner/editor/viewer
//! membership lives in `storage.role_grants` with
//! `resource_type='drive'`. That means **listing the drives a user can
//! reach goes through the role-grant query, not through this
//! repository**. This repo handles:
//!
//!   * Creating a drive (used by the user-creation lifecycle hook and
//!     by D3's shared-drive flow).
//!   * Looking up a single drive by id (used by the engine's owner_of /
//!     check paths, by `/api/drives/{id}`, and by the drive picker).
//!   * Finding the caller's default drive (used by the Photos / Music
//!     endpoints and by D1's redirect-from-`/` logic).
//!
//! Membership-flavoured queries (e.g. "list every drive user X can
//! read") live in `DriveListingService` (post-D0) which reads
//! `role_grants` and resolves the matching drive rows here.
