//! User-lifecycle hook port.
//!
//! Observer notified by [`AuthApplicationService`] when a user transitions
//! through one of four lifecycle events: created, login, logout, deleted.
//! Register concrete impls with [`UserLifecycleService`] during DI wiring;
//! the dispatcher fans out each event to every registered hook.
//!
//! Each impl owns ONE concern. Folder service owns home-folder provisioning,
//! authz engine owns its cache invalidation, audit service owns the audit
//! trail, etc. New services plug in by registering a hook; the dispatcher
//! itself never gains domain knowledge.
//!
//! # Convention: explicit no-ops
//!
//! Every implementor **must** provide all four methods — use an explicit
//! one-liner `Ok(())` for events the implementor does not care about. This
//! forces conscious acknowledgement of every lifecycle event rather than
//! silent omission via trait defaults. Mirrors the [`FileLifecycleHook`]
//! convention at `application/ports/file_lifecycle.rs`.
//!
//! # Convention: async + per-event semantics
//!
//! Unlike [`FileLifecycleHook`] (sync fire-and-forget), user-lifecycle
//! events are async because some require synchronous semantics:
//! provisioning must finish before the session token is returned;
//! deletion cleanup must commit atomically with the user DELETE.
//!
//! Per-event failure model (encoded in the dispatcher, not the trait):
//!
//! | Event              | Awaited? | On `Err`?                              |
//! |--------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|
//! | `on_user_created`  | yes      | log-and-continue (retry on next login) |
//! | `on_user_login`    | yes      | log-and-continue (idempotent retry)    |
//! | `on_user_logout`   | no       | fire-and-forget (spawned), error logged|
//! | `on_user_deleted`  | yes      | log-and-continue today; PR 4 will switch to abort-the-transaction once the dispatcher fires inside the delete tx |
//!
//! # Tips for hook implementors
//!
//! 1. **First-ever login detection.** `on_user_login` fires after
//!    credentials validate but **before** `user.register_login()` is
//!    called for this session. So `user.last_login_at().is_none()` is a
//!    reliable "this is the first login since account creation" signal —
//!    useful for welcome emails, one-shot default-resource seeding,
//!    "complete your profile" prompts.
//!
//! 2. **External-user short-circuit.** Every hook that provisions or
//!    manages user-owned resources (folders, calendars, address books)
//!    should start with `if user.is_external() { return Ok(()); }`.
//!    External users are grant-only — they don't own storage. The
//!    `is_external` flag lands in PR 2 of this work; until then, treat
//!    every user as internal.
//!
//! 3. **Idempotency is mandatory.** `on_user_login` fires on every
//!    successful authentication. A hook that creates a resource must
//!    first check whether the resource already exists. Same for cache
//!    invalidation, audit deduplication, etc. The `on_user_login`
//!    safety-net only works if hooks no-op when their work is already
//!    done.
//!
//! 4. **External → internal conversion needs no special event.** When
//!    admin converts an external user to internal (`UPDATE auth.users
//!    SET is_external = FALSE`), the user's next login fires
//!    `on_user_login` with the new flag value. Idempotent hooks see
//!    `!is_external` + missing resources → provision. No
//!    `on_user_converted` method needed.
//!
//! 5. **Per-session logout firing.** When a flow revokes multiple
//!    sessions (e.g. `revoke_all_user_sessions` on password change),
//!    today the dispatcher fires `on_user_logout` ONCE per logical
//!    revoke-call. PR 4's `SessionRevocationLifecycleHook` will refine
//!    this to once-per-session for proper audit granularity. Hooks must
//!    therefore accept N redundant calls with the same reason — keep
//!    them idempotent and side-effect-free.
//!
//! 6. **Failure swallowing on create/login.** If your hook returns
//!    `Err`, the user is still created / logged in; only your hook's
//!    effect is delayed. Log enough detail via `tracing::error!` that a
//!    subsequent investigation can identify the user and retry
//!    manually. The `on_user_login` safety-net will retry on the next
//!    successful authentication.
//!
//! 7. **`on_user_deleted` is post-commit today.** The user row is
//!    already gone when the hook fires. Returning `Err` cannot roll
//!    back the delete. PR 4 will refactor `delete_user_admin` to expose
//!    a transaction handle, at which point the trait gains a `tx:
//!    &mut Transaction` parameter and `Err` will abort the delete. For
//!    now: best-effort cleanup, log failures, don't assume atomicity.
//!
//! 8. **Hook order is registration order.** The DI factory at
//!    [`AppServiceFactory`] determines the firing sequence. If two hooks
//!    have an ordering dependency (e.g. home-folder must exist before
//!    default-calendar can be seeded inside it), the dependent hook
//!    registers AFTER the producer. Document the convention in the DI
//!    block where order matters.
