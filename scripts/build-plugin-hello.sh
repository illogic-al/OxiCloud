# (src/infrastructure/services/plugins/runtime_test.rs).

# The generated artifacts ARE committed — like the vendored BLAKE3 module — so
# regular builds and `cargo test --features plugins` never need the wasm
# toolchain. Re-run this only when wasm/oxicloud-plugin-hello/ changes, and
# commit the regenerated files. CI rebuilds them and fails on any diff.
#
# Requirements (one-time):
#   - the wasm32-unknown-unknown target. In the devenv this is provided by
#     `languages.rust.targets` in devenv.nix; otherwise:
#         rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
